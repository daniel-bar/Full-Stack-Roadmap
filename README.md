# Full-Stack-Roadmap
How to become a Full Stack Developer?

I'm going to focus on web development.

Firstly you have to know English, if you don't, go learn English and comeback :)

# I'm going to talk about the following ways for becoming a developer:

  A. Degree.
  
  B. Bootcamp.
  
  C. Self taught.
  
# The article is going to mostly take into consideration the following variables: 

  A. Money.
  
  B. Time.
  
  C. Relevance of technologies that the industry uses.
  
  D. Self discipline - I'll finish with that now and say that Degree & Bootcamp are coming with teachers, tutors, schedule & classmates. When you Self taught you can find Discord servers, Whatsapp teams or friends that can help.

  
## A. Degree
In a degree most of the courses won't be prectical for development. Look at this post from a software engineer at Meta - [Post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/avi-lewis_%D7%94%D7%90%D7%9D-%D7%AA%D7%95%D7%90%D7%A8-%D7%91%D7%9E%D7%93%D7%A2%D7%99-%D7%9E%D7%97%D7%A9%D7%91-%D7%91%D7%90%D7%9E%D7%AA-%D7%A8%D7%9C%D7%95%D7%95%D7%A0%D7%98%D7%99-%D7%9C%D7%A2%D7%91%D7%95%D7%93%D7%AA-%D7%94%D7%99%D7%95%D7%9D-activity-6873009869566418944-rrTy/).

He explains well what he uses and what not in this picture: (pic from his post)

![This is an image](https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C5622AQEnnatJPxjd3A/feedshare-shrink_800/0/1638653246384?e=1655337600&v=beta&t=VHvkO_ehK9pYCEPQO26MUW0oRqQStMiNI5PEgf8pydo)

There is no need to do a degree for the courses that he says he uses in his day work, because you can learn them in UDemy or another online courses website.

And also for web dvelopment you don't need to know C/C++, OOP or Computer science Introduction so Degree has almost no impact on day to day work in web development, although learning code language will help you to become a developer & learning what is OOP (Object-oriented programming) is important.
  
Degree will expaned your knowledge in Math, Computer Science & it will get you better at solving problems.

It will cost you about 30K-40K NIS & Will take you 3 years to finish.

It's not updated to the new technologies so you will have to learn them at your own time. (You can also try to go after a degree to places like [infinitylabs.co.il](https://infinitylabs.co.il/%D7%9E%D7%A1%D7%9C%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%99-%D7%94%D7%9B%D7%A9%D7%A8%D7%94/) which take's only a degree graduates. They will make you a developer, not the degree).

It gets stressful for some people.

conclusion: Most expensive, irrelevant and time killing way to become a developer.
  
## B. Bootcamp
Bootcamp will give you guidance, But I know for a fact that alot of bootcamps "finds a job" for there graduates as tutors in their bootcamp.
That's not a good idea because you don't want someone without experience teaching you how to code it will lead you to bad prectices.

The cost is about 20K NIS.

It will take you from 12 weeks to a year to finish (Depends on the bootcamp program).

Bootcamps are not always fully updated with the new technologies, there are still bootcamps at 2022 who teach JQuery & PHP.

## C. Self taught
Practical & Cheap. Do it whenever you want style.

You can learn everything for [academind.com](academind.com), it will cost you 200$ for one year subscription.

For this way I'll also provide a list of the courses & more.
