How to become a web Full Stack Developer?

Firstly you have to know English, if you don't go learn English and comeback :). 

I'm going to talk about the following ways for becoming a developer:

  A. Degree.
  
  B. Bootcamp.
  
  C. Self taught.
  
## A. Degree
In a degree most of the courses won't be prectical for web development. Look at this [Post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/avi-lewis_%D7%94%D7%90%D7%9D-%D7%AA%D7%95%D7%90%D7%A8-%D7%91%D7%9E%D7%93%D7%A2%D7%99-%D7%9E%D7%97%D7%A9%D7%91-%D7%91%D7%90%D7%9E%D7%AA-%D7%A8%D7%9C%D7%95%D7%95%D7%A0%D7%98%D7%99-%D7%9C%D7%A2%D7%91%D7%95%D7%93%D7%AA-%D7%94%D7%99%D7%95%D7%9D-activity-6873009869566418944-rrTy/).

He explains there well what he uses and what not in this picture:

There is no need to do a degree for the courses that he says he uses in his day work, because you can learn them in UDemy or another online courses website.

And also for web dvelopment you don't need to know C/C++.
  
Degree will expaned your knowledge in Math & it will get you better at solving problems.

It will cost you about 30K-40K NIS & Will take you 3 years to finish.

It's not updated to the new technologies so you will have to learn them on your own time.

It gets stressful for some people.
  
## B. Bootcamp
Bootcamp will give you guidance (not always good because a developer needs to learn to solve the problems by himself & google).

On the other side bootcamp gets you to basic/below level, I know for a fact that alot of bootcamps "finds a job" for there graduates as tutors in their bootcamp.
That's not a good idea because you don't want someone without experience teaching you how to code it will lead you to bad prectices & It will cost you about 20K NIS.

Bootcamps are not always fully updated with the new technologies, there are still bootcamps at 2022 who teach JQuery.

## C. Self taught
Practical & Cheap.

You can learn everything for [academind.com](academind.com), it will cost you 200$ for one year subscription.
